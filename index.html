          <h2>📊Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age📈</h2>
          <p>The American Community Survey is the only source of small area estimates for social and demographic 
            characteristics, per the census.gov website. The ACS gives communities the current information they need to plan
            investments and services.</p>

           <p> I was impressed that the census.gov site notes that all comparisions made in the reports have been tested and 
            found to be statiscally significant at the 90% confidence level, unless otherwise noted. A point that instills
            confidence in me in the data provided.</p>

            <p>This data covers the average age and percentage of those without insurance by state.
            Texas had the highest percentage of people without healthcare by age at nearly 25% of Texans with out
            healthcare at an average age of 34. The state of Massachusets appears to have the lowest population without
            healthcare at 4.6% and an average age of those without insurance at 39.4. Virginia was of note to me personally 
            since I live there, with an average age of those without insurance at 37.7 and 13% of those residing in the 
            commonwealth of Virginia without insurance.</p>

            <p>The dataset I visualized above shows the correlation between age and lack of health insurance by state. By hovering
            over the individual state circles you can capture the state, average age and percentage of residents without health
            insurance. The ages range between 30-44 and between 4.6% and 24.9% without insurance.
            Upon reviewing the website further I was able to drill down into the correlation between health insurance status and 
            all ages from under 5 years to over 85 years and the results support my data in the table above. Overall as age
            increases health insurance status increases. I look forward to adding more interactive elements in the future so the
            user can analyze the other factors in the data such as obesity, poverty, and smoking.</p>
